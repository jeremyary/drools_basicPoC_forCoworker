Covers basic usage of drools rule engine including how to stand up and run the engine, basic rule sytax, and how to test against working memory and the agenda.

I recommend starting with a look at messageRules.drl and MessageRulesTest.java as I've documented via comment the intentions of
the project and each test/component of the rule engine.

If there's anything you'd like to see further demonstrated, please let me know.
